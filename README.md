## 💻 Laravel & Web Development
I have **hands-on experience with the Laravel PHP framework**, working on both small-scale projects and large systems. Here are some of the key areas where I have gained expertise:
- **API Development**: Experience building RESTful APIs with Laravel's Eloquent ORM and resources, including handling authentication with **Sanctum** and **Passport** for security. I have also applied Test-Driven Development (TDD) to enhance code reliability.
- **MVC Design**: Mastery of Laravel's **MVC architecture** and its associated tools like **Blade templating**, **facades**, and **middleware** for managing request lifecycles.
- **Database Management**: Comfortable using **Laravel's migration**, **seeding**, and **Eloquent ORM** for efficient data handling, and working with complex relationships such as **one-to-many** and **many-to-many**.
- **Freelancing Projects**: I have completed various freelance Laravel projects ranging from **job boards**, **simple CRM systems**, and **e-commerce platforms** to custom web applications using **Vue.js** or **React.js** alongside Laravel.
- **Automated Testing**: Proficient with **Laravel Dusk** and PHPUnit for ensuring application stability and implementing **continuous integration pipelines** during deployment.
